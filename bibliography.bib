	abstract = {In a seminal article, Cox (1990) suggested that electoral systems with larger district magnitudes provide incentives for parties to advocate more extreme policy positions. In this article, we put this proposition to the test. Informed by recent advances in spatial models of party competition, we introduce a design that embeds the effect of electoral rules in the utility function of voters. We then estimate the equilibrium location of parties as the weight voters attach to the expected distribution of seats and votes changes. Our model predicts that electoral rules affect large and small parties in different ways. We find centripetal effects only for parties that are favorably biased by electoral rules. By contrast, smaller parties see their vote share decline and are pushed toward more extreme equilibrium positions. Evidence from 13 parliamentary democracies supports model predictions. Along with testing the incentives provided by electoral rules, results carry implications for the strategies of vote-maximizing parties and for the role of small parties in multiparty competition.},

	doi = {10.2478/cejpp-2023-0004},
	abstract = {This paper is a configurational analysis that creates a new theoretical elaboration of populist parties in Europe in terms of policy choices. The forms of populism that we can see in contemporary Europe are new, relevant and do not have a theoretical representation in the literature. This paper also provides a clearer understanding of the characteristics of populist and anti-establishment parties in Europe, which can provide valuable insights into likely responses to reformed policy environments. To do so, the paper analyses policy positions connected to the populist literature for 242 parties in Europe in 2014 and 2019 using the Chapell Hill Expert Survey and the {PopuList} Survey data. Groups of parties with similarly held positions in 2014 and 2019 are identified using cluster analysis to investigate whether differences in positions are defined predominately according to a national, east–west, right–left faction or other criteria. The result highlights that rather than across a classical right–left divide connotation, Europe can be divided into four clusters: right-wing populists, a moderate pro-Europe left, a pro-Europe pro-liberalism centre and an intersectional left based on identity politics. Overall, the moderate left and the centrist liberalism centre are the most common parties across Europe, and the other two factions seem to be born as a reaction to these two. However, the other two factions are growing over the years, especially the populist right-wing in Central and Eastern Europe. This brings to light serious policy implications for the future of the European Union and for considering populism simply as a discursive matter.},

It seeks to extend the finding presented in the classical "median voter theorem" to a wide class of electoral systems--or to show the limits of such extension. The factors examined are the district magnitude, the electoral formula, the number of votes each voter is allowed to cast, whether voters can cumulate their votes, and whether voters can "partially abstain." I suggest a crude division of electoral systems into those producing predominantly centripetal incentives and those producing predominantly centrifugal incentives. Among the factors found to produce centripetal incentives, at least in noncumulative systems, are the following: increases in the number of votes per voter; outlawry of "partial abstention"; and decreases in the district magnitude. In systems allowing the cumulation of votes, matters are a bit different.},

	abstract = {Online Voting Advice Applications ({VAAs}) are survey-like instruments that help citizens to shape their political preferences and compare them with those of political parties. Especially in multi-party democracies, their increasing popularity indicates that {VAAs} play an important role in opinion formation for citizens, as well as in the public debate prior to elections. Hence, the objectivity and transparency of {VAAs} are crucial. In the design of {VAAs}, many choices have to be made. Extant research in survey methodology shows that the seemingly arbitrary choice to word questions positively (e.g., ‘The city council should allow cars into the city centre’) or negatively (‘The city council should ban cars from the city centre’) systematically affects the answers. This asymmetry in answers is in line with work on negativity bias in other areas of linguistics and psychology. Building on these findings, this study investigated whether question polarity also affects the answers to {VAA} statements. In a field experiment (N = 31,112) during the Dutch municipal elections we analysed the effects of polarity for 16 out of 30 {VAA} statements with a large variety of linguistic contrasts. Analyses show a significant effect of question wording for questions containing a wide range of implicit negations (such as ‘forbid’ vs. ‘allow’), as well as for questions with explicit negations (e.g., ‘not’). These effects of question polarity are found especially for {VAA} users with lower levels of political sophistication. As these citizens are an important target group for Voting Advice Applications, this stresses the need for {VAA} builders to be sensitive to wording choices when designing {VAAs}. This study is the first to show such consistent wording effects not only for political attitude questions with implicit negations in {VAAs}, but also for political questions containing explicit negations.},

The current research investigated whether {VAAs} live up to this expectation by investigating to what extent {VAAs} affected users' political knowledge and vote choice in the Dutch national elections of 2012. Results show that {VAA} users feel that the {VAA} improved their political knowledge. In addition, those groups of {VAA} users who experienced a large knowledge increase, also relatively often indicated that their vote choice had been affected. This suggests that {VAAs} contribute to informational transparency by increasing knowledge among a potentially wide audience, and also that {VAAs} might increase democratic representation to the extent that {VAAs} persuade people to vote for the candidate that best represents their opinions. On the other hand, we found discrepancies between behavioural and perceptual measurements of the effect of {VAAs} on vote choice. This raises doubts about whether {VAAs} shape actual voting behaviours and knowledge, or rather perceptions of that.},

Often {VAAs} will advise users to opt for parties that they were already likely to vote for, based on antecedent factors. Here, three-wave panel surveys and media content data for the Dutch national election campaigns of 2010 and 2012 are employed. In spite of spurious correlations resulting from common antecedent factors, genuine {VAA} effects show up, especially for doubting voters. Party change based on positive {VAA}-advice for a party is least likely (a) for voters who already have an abundance of antecedent factors in favour of that party anyway, and (b) for those without a single antecedent factor in favour of that party. Genuine {VAA} effects imply that {VAAs} make it less easy for political parties to neglect each other's owned issues, because {VAAs} weigh issues equally for each party.},

In the three step approach; first the bipartite graph is converted into a unipartite graph with the help of a weighted projection, next the potential energy and mutual information between each node pair in the projected graph is computed. Finally, we present Potential Energy-Mutual Information based similarity metric which helps in prediction of potential links. To evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm four similarity metrics, namely {AUC}, Precision, Prediction-power and Precision@K were calculated and compared with eleven baseline algorithms. The Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the baseline algorithms.},

The analyses are based on the actual answers given by users of one of the most popular {VAAs} in Europe, {StemWijzer} in the Netherlands. The results indicate that the advice depends strongly on the spatial model adopted. A majority of the users of {StemWijzer} would have received another advice, if another spatial model had been used. At the aggregate level this means that how often a particular party is presented as best match depends strongly on the method used to determine the advice. These findings have important implications for the design of future {VAAs}.},

	abstract = {Voting Advice Applications ({VAAs}) have enjoyed a growing popularity across Europe in recent years and, increasingly, in other parts of the globe too. In response a growing literature is emerging around the promises and potential perils associated with {VAAs}. This paper contributes to these debates by addressing a core methodological aspect of {VAA} design: how voters' policy preferences are aggregated to produce measures of concordance with parties/candidates. To this end, the paper analyses the performance of four {VAA} models that are based on competing algorithms. The findings, which draw from the analysis of {VAA}-generated data from four experiments, raise a number of concerns for the future design of {VAA} systems.},

A successful branch of {VAAs} uses multidimensional models of the political space to inform users of their policy match with political parties. Creators of these {VAAs} offer only a very generalized justification for the choice of their underlying spatial model. We examine whether these spatial representations offer a valid depiction of policy differences between parties. We compare the spatial models from the available national ‘electoral compasses’, which include established democracies as well as semi-authoritarian and transitional systems. We find that the two-dimensional ‘one-size fits all’ model that is used in all of these countries fails to accommodate significant variation between party systems.},

Research on democratic representation has traditionally been skeptical about voters’ ability to navigate this complexity. However, voting advice applications ({VAAs}) offer voters a shortcut to compare their own preferences across numerous issues with those of a large number of political candidates. As {VAAs} become more prevalent, it is critical to understand whether and how voters use them when they vote. We analyze how {VAA} users process and use {VAA} information about their district candidates with original survey data from the 2019 Danish parliamentary election in collaboration with the administrators of one of the most widely used Danish {VAAs}. The results demonstrate that {VAAs} have substantively large effects on their users’ choices between parties and between candidates within parties.},

	abstract = {Statistical models for social networks have enabled researchers to study complex social phenomena that give rise to observed patterns of relationships among social actors and to gain a rich understanding of the interdependent nature of social ties and actors. Much of this research has focused on social networks within medium to large social groups. To date, these advances in statistical models for social networks, and in particular, of Exponential-Family Random Graph Models ({ERGMS}), have rarely been applied to the study of small networks, despite small network data in teams, families, and personal networks being common in many fields. In this paper, we revisit the estimation of {ERGMs} for small networks and propose using exhaustive enumeration when possible. We developed an R package that implements the estimation of pooled {ERGMs} for small networks using Maximum Likelihood Estimation ({MLE}), called “ergmito”. Based on the results of an extensive simulation study to assess the properties of the {MLE} estimator, we conclude that there are several benefits of direct {MLE} estimation compared to approximate methods and that this creates opportunities for valuable methodological innovations that can be applied to modeling social networks with {ERGMs}.},

They typically consist of a number of statements that are used to match voters with parties. Drawing on a large-scale simulation of 500,000 different configurations of 36 statements and on a random sample of Belgian voters, the paper shows that many of these combinations produce diverging information for the participants. The study establishes that the specific selection of statements has a considerable impact on the ‘voting advice’ that is produced: some configurations favour certain parties, other configurations benefit other parties.},

In this paper we analyse whether the meaning of left-right orientation is the same in Eastern Europe and Western Europe. Using data from two big European survey programmes, European Social Survey and European Values Study, we show that while citizens’ support for economic liberalism is positively related to their left-right political auto-identification, their support for cultural liberalism is negatively related. More importantly, we also present evidence for the regional diversity hypothesis, which shows that this pattern was more prominent among citizens of Western European countries those of Eastern European countries. The results confirm the specificity of Eastern Europe when it comes to relationships between political auto-identification and other beliefs that are traditionally linked, implying that the concept of left-right political auto-identification cannot be transferred mechanically between Eastern Europe and Western Europe.},

Using new data from the 2008 Austrian National Election Study, we test the proximity and directional model of voting, Grofman’s discounting model and Kedar’s compensational model of voting. We find that Grofman’s discounting model performs best predicting party policy positions. Yet, not all party policy positions are predicted equally well. The most obvious misrepresentation is that the rightist {FPÖ} is placed close to the centre of the policy space. This centripetal bias, which has also been found in earlier work, may result from simplifying assumptions of the algorithm used to derive Nash equilibria of party policy positions that need to be challenged. Our findings emphasize the necessity to test models of party competition using new data and to motivate further research explaining party position-taking.},
